# Visualizer
## jQuery plugin for easy visualization of datastes

Visualizer allows developers to easily organize and manage visual elements for large datasets on top of images.

### To get started, here are the following rules:
1. Put an id of 'visual-container' around the containing div that holds the background image and the datasets you wish to show and hide on.
2. On each data set, give it a unique id and a class of 'visual-set'
3. Create a select element with an id of 'visual-set-select', and give each option a value that that matches the unique id of the dataset you wish to show when it's selected
4. Profit!

### General Notes:
1. Obviously, visualizer needs jquery to operate. Please include jQuery before this script.
2. Style it however you like -- visualizer is all logic and comes with no style sheets -- it is (mostly) style-agnostic.
3. Just download the zip (look to your right) and include visualizer.js in your project and BOOM! you're visualizing datasets!
